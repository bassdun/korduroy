Korduroy.tv
========

Korduroy.tv is a website spreading digital aloha. Through video how-toâ€™s, short films, rants and interviews we are creating a new platform for independent surf culture: a place where ideas can be shared that respect self-sufficiency, craftsmanship, and a surfing experience of our own design.

We are currently migrating our rails site back over to wordpress (backwards as all hell, but it does make sense given the context), because it is better suited for our needs. This is the repo for that project. Yew!

-----------

The theme we are using is the Korduroy Theme. Should be the only theme available.

Tools:
- We are using sass for css compiling (found in assets => scss)
- Grunt for live-reloading, js uglification and linting, image compression, and other automation candy.
- Deployment is still TBD.
