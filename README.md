Korduroy.tv
========

Korduroy.tv is a website spreading digital aloha. Through video how-toâ€™s, short films, rants and interviews we are creating a new platform for independent surf culture: a place where ideas can be shared that respect self-sufficiency, craftsmanship, and a surfing experience of our own design.

We are currently migrating our rails site back over to wordpress, because it is better suited for our needs. This is the repo for that project. Yew!
