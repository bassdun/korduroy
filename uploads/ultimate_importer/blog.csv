4,"5 Ways To Not Surf on ISD (and still get stoked)","<p class="p1"><em>by Korduroy Founder Cyrus Sutton</em></p>\n<p class="p1"><em><strong>* Update: The waves ended up being fun for most of Western North America with light crowds. So consider the following tips any day the surf sucks! YEW!<br /></strong></em></p>\n<p class="p1">While I support everything International Surfing Day (now commonly referred to as ISD) stands for, waves are a very limited commodity where I live and the thought of suiting up past the hash-tagging masses struggling to get into their crusty suits on their collective day of surf hooky just doesn't get me stoked.</p>\n<p class="p1">Beginning with post World War II vets, core California surf culture has always been about ebbing while others flow and gleaning joy from less foraged pastures.

5,"Retractable Fin Design","<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/sr62GXcDOPs" frameborder="0" width="720" height="405"></iframe></p>\n<p>I got the idea for the retractable fin set up while I was on a sailing trip. I joined a boat that was doing the Baja Haha sailing race, which is a race that starts in San Diego and ends in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. We caught a tuna fish, and our captain, a photographer, was taking close up shots of the fish while inspecting it. As he was taking photos he said, &ldquo;Wow, look at how hydrodynamic the fin of this fish is&rdquo;. And that is when a light went on in my head. This fish has a dent in the side of its body that allows the fin to go within its body. This makes it possible for the fish to use its fin to change direction, but also have the option to retract its fin within its body so that it can swim faster. And I thought, why not do that with surfboards?</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/469/hydrodynamics-tuna.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p>I definitely have geeked out to the blogs that the Wegener brothers post to see what kind of finless shapes they&rsquo;re coming up with. But since the retractable fin setup is a new concept, I am still in the process of figuring out a shape that will work well with and without fins. I&rsquo;m excited about the next shapes that I have in mind.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/470/retractable-fin-board.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p>The system is set up with two locking mechanisms on both sides of the fin that keep the fins temporarily in place while riding the wave. The fin has a string connected to it, that leads to your thigh. So the surfer can pull the fins out at any time while surfing on a wave.</p>\n<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4UdVDHwMpLo" frameborder="0" width="720" height="405"></iframe></p>\n<p>You just ride the board like you would ride any other type of board that has fins, and choose a section of the wave where you would like to go finless. It is so fun to race down a wave as fast as you can with fins and then retract them to do whatever finless maneuver you want to do. It is a totally unique sensation.</p>\n<p>After testing it out, there are definitely going to be some changes with the next board. The fins need to be made with a soft rubber on its sharpest parts, so that the surfer doesn&rsquo;t get cut up when the fins are retracted...amongst other things.</p>\n<p>- Nathan Mehring</p>\n<p>For more, check out&nbsp;<a href="http://linkesurf.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://linkesurf.blogspot.com/</a></p>","retractable-fin-design","retractable-fin-slider.jpg",0

8,"Saltwater Buddha the Film: behind the scenes","<p><strong><em>Reis Paluso at KorduroyTV recently asked me what the challenges were in bringing <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/690533062/saltwater-buddha-the-film-1">Saltwater Buddha, the film,</a> to life. Though there were many, the biggest was probably fixing my own head.</em></strong></p>\n<p>When <a href="http://www.saltwaterbuddha.org/Team.html">Nohoch Productions</a> asked me back in 2009 if they could turn <a href="http://www.jaimalyogis.com/?page_id=54">Saltwater Buddha, the book,</a> into a film, I felt similar to when my high school crush &ndash; a terrifying <em>full grade </em>ahead of me &ndash; asked me to the Sadie Hawkins dance. Excited,&nbsp; but the overwhelming feeling was that of getting ready to pee in my pants.</p>\n<p><iframe src="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/690533062/saltwater-buddha-the-film-1/widget/video.html" frameborder="0" width="480px" height="360px"></iframe></p>\n<p>There were just too many potential ways to screw it all up: I&rsquo;m camera shy, not a pro surfer, and nobody funds surf films these days anyway, certainly not ones about unknown teenagers running away from home to find themselves. How would my story possibly compete for limited funding dollars with rodeo flips and thong bikinis? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sure, if you can get the money,&rdquo; I told Lara Popyack, the director, part of me almost hoping she wouldn&rsquo;t. Then I&rsquo;d be off the hook.</p>\n<p>We did get a few grand, but not surprisingly, the money didn&rsquo;t exactly pour in at first. But Lara was indefatigable. She and her husband Mike Madden took time off from their busy jobs as television news producers (and twin boys) to start making a trailer.&nbsp; Lara rallied product sponsorships from brands like <a href="http://www.sanuk.com/">Sanuk </a>to keep the team inspired.&nbsp; (I realized I will do a lot of things for free shoes.) But to be honest, even when we were filming with fresh Sanuks on our feet, I still didn&rsquo;t <em>believe</em> the film would happen.</p>\n<p>It was a full year into trying to scrap together footage &ndash; when Lara told me the real reason why she was so determined to make the film &ndash; that changed everything.&nbsp; In 2004, <a href="http://www.christianhamel.com/">Christian Hamel,</a> one of Lara&rsquo;s best friends, died of brain cancer at just 33-years-old, leaving behind a young daughter, Lorrynn. Hamel was known in Santa Cruz as one of the most graceful longboarders on the scene, and Lara had lived with her during her third brain tumor (the fourth would kill her) helping her sneak out against the docs&rsquo; orders for surf sessions. "The ocean was her refuge, her path, her everything," Lara told me. "I want to put her relationship to water on film."&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/690533062/saltwater-buddha-the-film-1"> Saltwater Buddha</a></em> was the first story Lara had found that got the essence of what Hamel was about. I got teary-eyed listening and realized I&rsquo;d been viewing the film selfishly &ndash; a personal risk. What would everyone think of <em>me</em> if it failed? I hadn&rsquo;t been seeing that risk as worth taking to honor people like Hamel, people who go to the ocean as their church.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="http://www.korduroy.tv/uploads/image/image/468/christian_surfing.jpeg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p><em>(Here's Hamel in her refuge.</em>)</p>\n<p>Death has a way of clarifying life and when I heard the story, I suddenly got faith &ndash; pow! &ndash; like remembering a dream I&rsquo;d forgotten. I knew the film had to be made. I knew it would be made.</p>\n<p>I also realized I hadn&rsquo;t even tried to help get funding myself because the part of me that was scared of looking stupid on camera had been making excuses why I shouldn&rsquo;t. I really only knew one guy who had the kind of money to fund our travel to Hawaii and New York, necessary plot points, but still, I hadn&rsquo;t even asked him. That guy was my best friend from&nbsp; childhood, <a href="http://urijahfaber.com/">Urijah Faber,</a> who had become, funny enough, a professional ass kicker. He was a champion UFC fighter and had, since college, been bloodying noses, making loot, buying up real estate around the world with that loot, appearing with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxtNrVVVWVo">Kenny Powers in K-Swiss commercials</a>, and starting successful clothing lines like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4uV0exfZs0">FORM Athletics</a>. But why would Urijah &ndash; with his I&rsquo;ll-kick-your-face-in-for-breakfast image &ndash; fund his old friend&rsquo;s film about Zen and surfing?</p>\n<p>I had no idea, but thinking of Hamel, I texted Urijah, cringing about asking him for money after not being in touch for about a year. Oddly enough, he called me right away. &ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; was his response, &ldquo;I can probably only spare like 20, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Twenty bucks?&rdquo; I said, thinking, <em>hey, that&rsquo;s not bad</em>.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Thousand,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>I almost dropped the phone.</p>\n<p>So: a UFC mega stud as our EP, flying to Hawaii, I kept thinking, <em>how in the hell is this happening? We&rsquo;re making a freaking surf movie! </em>But there we were. With Hamel&rsquo;s spirit, Lara&rsquo;s drive, and Urijah&rsquo;s money guiding us, we were unstoppable. And the footage &ndash; contrary to my fears &ndash; was gorgeous, even <em>sans</em> rodeo flips.</p>\n<p>The rest of the filming &ndash; in El Salvador, California, and Costa Rica &ndash; seemed to just flow. <a href="http://www.surfforlife.org/">Surf for Life</a>, the non-profit that gets surfers to build schools in Central America, agreed to help us with lodging as long as we were willing to lay some concrete for their high school projects (it was an honor). Borrowed Lenses donated equipment; <a href="http://www.lasolassurfboards.com/">Las Olas surfboards</a> made us a gorgeous custom 7&rsquo;2&rdquo; with a Japanese Enso emblazoned on the nose; <a href="http://www.ninepoundshadow.com/">Nine Pound Shadow</a>, Jim Klar and Michael Eaton, donated music; Sanuk kept the shoes flowing; and <a href="http://www.oneill.com/">Oneill </a>gave us wetsuits at cost. Every little bit helped.</p>\n<p>I think it was in El Salvador, the film crew laying concrete bricks in 95-degree heat for Surf for Life&rsquo;s El Cuco high school, that I realized, whether the film actually got made or not, didn&rsquo;t matter as much as the fact that we were making it. It has been said far too many times that the journey is the destination, but on that fourth and final trip, the feeling overwhelmed me.&nbsp; Not only did we get cool and talented surfers like <a href="http://hollybeckadventures.com/">Holly Beck</a>, <a href="http://hesssurfboards.com/">Danny Hess</a>, <a href="http://jaynelsonart.com/">Jay Nelson</a>, <a href="http://www.sanfranpsycho.com/pages/about_andy.html">Andy Olive</a>, <a href="http://www.surfforlife.org/tag/video/">Alex Fang</a>, <a href="http://thescuttlefish.com/">Brian Lam</a>, <a href="http://marklukach.com/">Mark Lukach</a>, and <a href="http://www.westerncivmag.com/">Ward Robinson</a> to come with us, Urijah even showed up to help build the school, intimidating the locals just by removing his shirt. And the coolest and most unbelievable part? Hamel&rsquo;s daughter, Lorrynn, now 17, came too, bringing the light and love that I&rsquo;m sure her mother exuded.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="http://www.korduroy.tv/uploads/image/image/467/302075_2418349543928_261575426_n.jpeg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p>Now that I&rsquo;m not surfing in El Salvador&rsquo;s warm water, doubt and fear often start to root their way in again.&nbsp; We have two terabytes of footage.

10,"Artist Interview: Silvano Zeiter","<p><em>Silvano Zeiter is a young yet uber talented photographer out of Switzerland who we think is taking some of the best photos in snowboarding. His use of light and the outdoor elements is reminescent of surf photographer Chris Burkard. Only being behind the lense for about 7 years, in 2010 Silvano bagged Red Bull's Illume award (photo below) for 'New Creativity' and has had shots published in almost every major snow and skate magazines. In addition to his outstanding photos, Silvano shares some insights and experience in the following interview:</em></p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/448/martinseiler_thehole_simp-Kopie.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p class="question">Tell us a little about your childhood. Where&rsquo;d you grow up and how&rsquo;d you get into snowboarding?</p>\n<p>I was born in Switzerland in 1990 and I grew up in a small village right in the middle of the Swiss Alps. The tram to the mountain is about 5 minutes from my door so like everybody else growing up there, I started skiing before I could even walk decently. Actually, I'm still a skiing today but I just got my first snowboard and I enjoy it as well. However, there are not many things in the world that make me happier than riding neckdeep powder.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/444/CookeSeries_MikeKnobel_CookeCity_4.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p class="question">What about photography? What&rsquo;s your background in the trade?</p>\n<p>As a kid I was already fascinated by looking through my mom's analog camera and playing with the depth of focus. At the age of about 15, I took my first photos and one day I had the opportunity to join a crew, who were lodging at our place, on a road gap shoot on the Simplon Pass. The pro-photographer lent me his Canon 1D and immediately I was so stoked that I decided I wanted to do this professionally some day. I bought my first DSLR and started taking photos of my snowboarding friends and in May 2008 I had my first shot published.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/445/FelskinnSaasFee2.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p class="question">Which elements do you look for when shooting? Do you prefer a certain time of day or place to shoot?</p>\n<p>I really like backlight so I prefer shooting in the afternoon or early morning when the sun is deep. But I think every daylight has it's benefits, it's just up to the photographer to make the best of it. Same thing for the snow conditions. Of course it's awesome to shoot in fresh powder but condition changes by winds or different temperatures can create beautiful structures on the surface. Shooting in the woods or urban stuff at night while it's dumping heavily is sick too except that the equipment has to suffer a little.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/447/MartinSeiler_splash_silvanozeiter_2_.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p class="question">Can you talk a little about your blog, <a href="http://silvanozeiter.blogspot.com" target="_blank">silvanozeiter.blogspot.com</a>?</p>\n<p>To be honest, I started a blog because everybody did it and at the beginning I wasn't really updating it a lot. But then I realized that it's a good opportunity to show the people that kind of photos that probably wouldn't make it into a magazine and stay untouched on my hard drive forever instead. So most of my work on the blog are photos I think they're worth to be seen. Lifestyle, portraits, landscapes and a little action from time to time. Some are classic, some are arty and others are just funny. In addition, the blog gives the people kind of an idea of what we're doing because most of the people have no idea what's all behind those action shots they see in magazines. At first I was kind of bummed that I couldn't show those action shots too but now I often prefer the photos that tell the story behind it.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/446/LeviLuggen_Fs3_1.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p class="question">What keeps you motivated to keep getting behind the lens?</p>\n<p>As cheesy as it may sound but it's definitely passion. Photography allows me to create a certain reality and I'm the one to control it and decide in which direction this reality is heading to. And that counts for every photographer from the pro-photographer to the iPhone-Hipstomatic-Dude.</p>\n<p>On the other hand it's the never ending process of learning and development that keeps getting me behind the lens. The curiosity to find out what's possible and how to progress your work.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/449/MatSchaer_Fs3_1.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p class="question">Have you tried your hand at any surf photography? Is that something you are interested in?</p>\n<p>Actually when I started taking photos it was my aspiration to become a surf-photographer and joining crews around the world one day. I've read a lot of surf magazines and watched many films and I just love it. As I started surfing myself I imagined that a surfphotographer has to be good at eating shit so I think it's tough. But I've also eaten some shit on the mountain so yes, I'd still be totally stoked to get the chance to join a surf crew some time.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/450/ShaneCharlebois_LesCrosets1.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p class="question">Your photos are extremely beautiful and inspiring- what equipment allows you to capture these elements so vividly in your work?</p>\n<p>Oh, thank you very much! I mainly use a Canon 5D Mark II with some zoom lenses of the Canon L-Series and a Sigma fisheye. As a second camera I have a 40D that I only use for sequences. In addition to that I have a Profoto Battery flash and some Canon Speedlites I use for night shoots and portraits. For snap shots I love my new Fujifilm Finepix x100. Obviously I'm all digital but I'd be really interested in taking photos on film but I haven't found the time yet to set up a decent darkroom. But I will.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/451/SimonGruber_Cab9.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p class="question">Aside from snowboarding and photography, what has been getting you stoked lately?</p>\n<p>Surfing has definitely become one of my beloved passions. I pretty much suck at it but maybe that's why I like it so much. Nobody gives a shit about how good or bad you are it's all about the fun of just doing it. Besides I really enjoy playing the guitar and listening to a lot of different kinds of music.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/443/BrandonCocard_LesCrosets_3.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p class="question">Where do you see yourself in a couple years time?</p>\n<p>I'll definitely try to keep gathering as much experience as possible by traveling the world and doing different assistant jobs and some free work to set up a studio here in Europe or maybe work in the Sates for some time. Who knows. But I'm sure wherever I'm gonna be I'll be having fun.</p>\n<p>Be sure to check out Silvano's website at&nbsp;<a title="Silvano Zeiter" href="http://www.silvanozeiter.com" target="_blank">http://www.silvanozeiter.com</a></p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/442/AuriAnthamatten_LeviLuggen_Belalp.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>","artist-interview-silvano-zeiter","SilvanoZeiter_slider.jpg",0

13,"Auditorium with Kevin Roche","<p>Here's a collection of images from my recent trip to Japan.&nbsp;I was looking to shoot real life and culture on the street. No portraits or action, just life in the unrehearsed.&nbsp;These are from Yokohama, Kamakura, and the Shibuya and Harijuku districts of Tokyo.&nbsp;This magnificent country and it&rsquo;s people, live where ancient meets modern, creating a fusion of culture which is unique to the land of the rising sun.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I chose this track for Auditorium because it references classical elements while simultaneously taking the listener on a contemporary journey. This feeling reflects my view of today's Japan and it's future.</p>\n<p>Japan's history and past are exemplified in the town of Kamakura, where monks walk quietly among the many temples nestled in hillside valleys and incense burns at the foot of the Great Buddha. Fishing boats line the shoreline as a reminder that this is an island nation inextricably connected to the sea.</p>\n<p>In Yokohama, there is a sense of engineering prowess and modernity through&nbsp;the efficiency of the workforce arriving via a crowded rail line and&nbsp;the dramatic architecture which dominates the skyline.&nbsp;Standard office attire here is the black suit which becomes a nondescript uniform, leaving little room for self expression and personal identity, and in a round about way, is like the buddhist subjugation of the self.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A stark contrast to this cultural homogeny are the&nbsp;Shibuya and Harijuku districts of Tokyo. Here, youth culture and consumerism are king, as seen in the Harijuku girls hyper-stylized fashions and the proliferation of Starbucks and high-end Western retailers. In these districts of Tokyo, popular culture embraces and celebrates the individual.</p>\n<p>On one hand it's a culture of many contradictions, while on the other, there's a sense of calm, order, and respect that pervades it all. It is a thing of grace and beauty...</p>\n<p><em>For more of his work, be sure to check out <a title="Kevin Roche" href="../../../makers/kevin-roche">Kevin's Maker profile</a>.</em></p>\n<p><iframe style="position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2174681589/size=venti/bgcol=FF&hellip;" frameborder="0" width="400" height="100"></iframe></p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/429/01ROCHE_02174.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" />&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/430/02ROCHE_02319.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/431/04ROCHE_03016.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/432/05ROCHE_03025.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/433/06ROCHE_02564.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/434/07ROCHE_03154.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/435/08ROCHE_03877.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/436/09ROCHE_03931.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/437/10ROCHE_03441.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/438/11ROCHE_03659.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/439/12ROCHE_03665.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/440/13ROCHE_03559.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/441/14ROCHE_03756.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>","auditorium-with-kevin-roche","03ROCHE_02947.jpg",0

How do you tastefully promote your work and what social mediums do you utilize (facebook, twitter, instagram, etc)?</p>\n<p>Uhhh... this is embarrassing to admit, but I suck at promoting myself. I started a blog about 12 years ago and have had a few ever since. Same goes for portfolio sites I've had for myself with time.</p>\n<p>I feel jinxed when it comes to finding the time and motivation to keep going on these things. I move on to something different. Honestly, I find that so many people that literally suck both as individuals and at what they do talk themselves up way too much. Especially through social media, where anybody and everybody can reach out. It makes me sort of a bit anti.</p>\n<p>I like the type of people that are humble about themselves and what they do. Design, photography, surfing, cooking, creating... whatever it is they do.

Then I sit down to start working as it gets dark when the rest of the world slows down.</p>\n<p>It is a great way to avoid crowds in both worlds. I don't like participating in the rat race. Not that I have a problem with people, but I just find that it more effective to work in my own rhythm without distractions like phone calls etc.</p>\n<p>When I am really into something, I will work on it for however long it takes. It can be 12 hour straight every day for weeks.

I prefer to work late and sleep late. I try not to do meetings before 11 am. My headspace is not really clear before. But sometimes I have to adapt because there is a whole world out there working differently. Which I of course totally understand and respect.</p>\n<p class="question">Or do you like to work unconventionally - work in streaks, odd hours, different locations?</p>\n<p>Yew, that's me. I have been at places where I am forced to break my patterns though. Often I don't end up working too long in those sort of environments.</p>\n<p>I understand that shit has to get finished for deadlines. That is extremely important to me and my profession. But I never will understand people demanding certain ways for no reasons...

Businesses have gone under just as my invoice got there.

He's currently dividing his time between running Korduroy, directing commericals, and acting as an ambassador for Reef.&nbsp;Portrait by <a title="Ryan Tatar" href="../../../makers/ryan-tatar">Ryan Tatar</a>.</em></strong></p>\n<p>As our economy increasingly relies upon the consumption of itself and the rehashing of previous cultural benchmarks to market its last vestiges,&nbsp;creativity is quickly becoming the layman's currency.&nbsp;Social networks are now cyber red-light districts where words, pictures and videos pose for the attention of patrons looking to spend their last dimes on fleeting feelings of authenticity. Unless you're an underpaid mental or physical tradesman, you've had to drink the Kool-Aid like the rest of us and walk the blurry line between contribution and exploitation. Gone are the days of working your way up. You are now either a follower or a leader. Working all day in an office building, I was once a follower. I was sick, poor and had no hope of change. I left and became stoked and broke. Now, I make things and spread these ideological and physical products to an unlikely cocktail of grassroots followers and product-driven companies.&nbsp;<br /><br />My life is the constant pursuit of extracting every ounce of creative juice from my skull. While I still love tying my brain into knots while attempting to distill every project's highest proof, my twenties have been spent learning moderation. Now my program is about ebbing and flowing between mental and physical work to maximize productivity and keep fresh perspectives. While lessons gleaned from repeatedly moving along a wave or trail aren't as tangible as the Google Analytics reports, it's the state my mind enters while on the move that guides and balances my on-grid attack.</p>\n<p>I am softening as well. I've got less to prove. No longer having to fixate on next month's rent payment, I am becoming more sensitive to the fact that we're are all at some level living lives of quiet desperation. The bugs of the system spare neither rich nor poor. We are&nbsp;all searching for touchstones in a world of facades.&nbsp;To have a shot at spiritual and physical abundance, we court inspiration like a wonder-drug. Those who keep the stoke become trendsetters, their every rap and step begetting more followers.</p>\n<p>But while the crowd marches on, the leaders know that the path to follow is more than just a good beat. It's blazed through a refined sense of instinctual attraction and repulsion separating the real from the bullshit. Out of respect for this inner compass, I try to remain a humble and faithful servant to both the darkest and brightest parts of life. Having freedom to enjoy the good life: posing for photos in beautiful locations or attending parties in big cities, I'm careful to hurry back to my purgatory in fear of losing touch with my creative struggle. Thus I choose a life of fulfilling hardship over blissful irrelevance. Whether this is sickness or virtue I'm not sure, all I know is that I'd rather find and spread the cure than deny it's lovely lonely grip. Struggle is my gift. Transcendence is my stoke. Escapism is my trap.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Do you have "Some Thoughts" on living a stoked life?

18,"The Maya Pool (DIY Backyard Pool)","<p><em>This article was originally from Confusion, a rad&nbsp;diy&nbsp;skating&nbsp;magazine/website - check them out at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.confuzine.com/" target="_blank">www.confuzine.com</a>.</em></p>\n<p>I think it&rsquo;s a dream of every skater to have his own ramp at home. Sure, I have my own ramp at home. Sure, it&rsquo;s a crazy big ramp, half bowl half mini ramp, etc. But sure its not a pool&hellip;.</p>\n<p>I&nbsp;have always said that I must build a pool for my daughter so that she doesn&rsquo;t grow up without her own backyard pool. When we rebuilt my barn, we had a lot of transitions and wood left over, so I planned to build a small ramp for Maya in my backyard in the next summer.</p>\n<p>In the&nbsp;<strong>middle of September</strong>, I wanted to just make some new grass in my backyard and I spoke to my uncle who owns a small landscape garden company. He said he will bring me a small bagger (bulldozer/excavator) to dig out the old stuff and fill in new earth. A day later &ndash; after I realized that I will get a bagger for free &ndash; I switched the plan with&nbsp;<strong>Maya&rsquo;s ramp</strong>&nbsp;and decided to make something in concrete.</p>\n<p>A few days later plans grew and I also ordered a trampoline which I also want set in a hole to have it on earth level.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/405/pool-1.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p>On the late evening of&nbsp;<strong>September 30th</strong>, we had the idea to go for a backyard pool and size the deep end diameter so that we can put in the trampoline.</p>\n<p>One day later we started to make the radiuses and found out the best position and sizes for the rest to fit the pool under the roof and between the pillars from the roof.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/406/pool-2.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p><strong>October 5th and 6th</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; We took 6 hours digging to complete the hole and filled in the earth in the rest of my garden for my new grass. A friend who works in a concrete pieces company &lsquo;organized&rsquo; us all the steel for free and we put it in and prepared everything for the first concrete.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/407/pool-3.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p><strong>October 10th</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; We started with the concrete.

At the end of the day we got 5 trailers with 2m&sup2; concrete in the pool. The biggest amount of concrete we ever have worked in one day.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/409/pool-5.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p><strong>October 15th</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; We got a 12 man crew and the concrete truck was coming at 9.30 am bringing 2.5m&sup2; of concrete. The first time every that we got a concrete truck. And when you just work with 5-10 cm concrete strength, that is a lot of surface to finish. Also our skills and equipment are getting more and more professional. We have made a finish and shape that most companies would be proud of&hellip;. all by hand and all by skaters.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/409/pool-5.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p>It's kind of&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.crazyleg-poolskate.com/" target="_blank">crazy</a></strong>&nbsp;to make a pool like this in just two weeks after the idea and the planning.&nbsp;<strong><em>Dreams comes true &ndash; sometimes it happens out of nowhere.

20,"Kissed By A Gypsy","<p>Words by Eli Curry. Photos by Simon Chipper</p>\n<p>There's this story amongst the crusty old cynics of the surfboard industry that whenever you get a new board the ocean shits itself. Nine times out of ten that is the case. But this time around, I was kissed by a gypsy.</p>\n<p>I got the call. She was to be ready on a Thursday afternoon. With the knowledge that I had Friday off, and that there was the potential of waves at one of my favourite island reef slabs, I went in to see the boys out the back. Hands were shook, thanks were given and out the door I was with my new partner in crime, smiling from ear to ear. &nbsp;<br />Gaining years, you'd think that the excitement of a new board would subside? But nup, there I am, on the couch with her smirking like the cat that got the cream, caressing the curves that my man, Glyndyn Ringrose, had carefully crafted, absolutely jumping out of my skin at the prospects of the next morning's waves with her.</p>\n<p>I arranged to meet my father, who was not two days back from a three month sojourn to Indonesia, in the carpark on the sparrow fart to asses the conditions. He was keen to shoot some shots on his new camera, and who was I to argue?</p>\n<p>Through the darkness we could see that it was on, not coming out of the sky, but a healthy enough size, and being caressed by our lovely old friend the Northerly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Given that the old man hadn't felt the chill of the Southern Ocean for awhile, I was taking great pleasure in telling him how cold it was. In turn, he chucked every piece of rubber he owned on: hood, boots, gloves, the whole kit! Off we chugged off down the beach, my old man only missing the ball in the mouth to complete the gimp look.&nbsp;Under my arm was six foot one worth of fun, with a six and a half inch single fin and two small outrigger fins to help me hold on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Slimbo, the glasser, wasn't at all pleased with the idea of having to revert to his past when I asked him to give it the full orange tint, but after a the added effort, he was as proud as punch with the finished result. In the twilight, she glowed like a beacon, a beacon I was chomping at the bit to get into the ocean. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It doesn't happen often, but every now and again you know as soon as you lay on a board it's all perfect.. the proportions of new girl were all perfect, she paddled like a dream, yet you could tell with the thinness in the tail there was going to be the sensitivity that I wanted. So far so good...</p>\n<p>There was only two other people out on my way into the lineup. Paddling past the inside bowl a set poured through. With a smidgen of south in the swell, the peak swung a little wider then usual, making the inside bowl horseshoe even more than usual and intensifying as it grew down the reef. As I stroked up this bending, twisting beauty and it spat at my face with disrespect, a disrespect I am willing to accept and challenge for the rest of my life.</p>\n<p>Here is my fight...</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/391/20120601-20120601-GOPR9050.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/392/20120602-2.5.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/393/20120602-2.6.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>","kissed-by-a-gypsy","eli-slide.jpg",0
21,"Wavegliders","<p>Intro &amp; interview by Korduroy contributor <a title="Carletes Saez" href="http://carletessaez.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Carlos Saez</a>.</p>\n<p>Surfers love surfboards, regardless of design or fashion trends, we have learned that we should ride whatever kind of board that fires our imagination. A surfboard is the link between the ocean and us. It is the object that provides us with that spiritual and mystical connection. It is our brush to draw lines in our water canvas. It is a magic tool to share the stoke, and is always a great feeling when we first put our hands on a new board. Many of our sport's shapers are not into this for the money, but to achieve the goal of making a living doing what they love and making people happy. I had the pleasure of visiting beautiful Portugal and meeting this crew of people that make beautiful surfboards, they were so welcoming and I enjoyed a lot to talk to them about what they do best. It is not a shaping bay, not a workshop, it is a bureau of stoked personnel. The Wave Gliders.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/385/IMG_3554-copia.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p class="question">Who is wavegliders can you tell us something about who is involved in this project?</p>\n<p>Wavegliders is an alternative 100% hand shaped surfboard manufacturer based near Ericeira.

It evolved to surfboard design and I started shaping in &acute;89 at my parents backyard and by &acute;97 was invited by Paulo Mandacaru to be his apprentice and in 2000 I shifted to Full &amp; Cas working as head shaper in Spain. That same year I started working for a local factory in portugal as a back shaper till &acute;09. Since then I've been working together with some shapers like Josh Hall, Ryan Lovelace and also did a collab with Blend Glassing (glassing for Channel Islands/Tom Parish/Billabong) in France.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/383/RSC_7433.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p class="question">Tell us something about your boards, Which one do you find yourself enjoying most these days?</p>\n<p>Our boards are made having in mind an alternative approach to wave riding other than high performance surfboards. We&acute;re influenced by many classical shapes, that we developed into modern designs.</p>\n<p>From the Mini Simmons to the big logs I&acute;m always stoked about all my boards. The Mini Simmons is one of the boards that I really love to shape because of all the history and concept behind it.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/381/RSC_2397.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p class="question">Has your interests changed and evolved over time regarding boards?</p>\n<p>Definitely. New influences are always showing up.

Where do you see it going in the future?</p>\n<p>It started changing when some foreign shapers started stopping by bringing new designs, new ideas and a new &ldquo;culture&rdquo; in surfing.</p>\n<p>Now and in the future we can see surfers starting to surf with designs that really suits their skills, their style and the waves they surf.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/386/Captura-56.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p class="question">What shapers inspires you the most?</p>\n<p>Bob Simmons, Dale Velzy, Skip Frye, George Greenough, Steve Lis, Josh Hall, Ryan Lovelace, Tyler Hatzikian, Gene Cooper.</p>\n<p class="question">Besides surfing, what else are you involved in?</p>\n<p>Video, photography and alternative lifestyle.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/387/Captura.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p class="question">What about the Salinas surf festival, I heard you go every year?</p>\n<p>Salinas is always the place to be year after year.</p>\n<p>We have a lot of friends and clients in Spain and in France, so Salinas is the perfect setting for an annual get together for the Wavegliders &ldquo;family&rdquo;.</p>\n<p><img class="inlinePostImage" src="../../../uploads/image/image/389/Captura-18.jpg" alt="" data-blogid="" data-imageid="" /></p>\n<p class="question">What can we expect from Wavegliders in the near future.</p>\n<p>We want to continue to develop our designs, by traveling around the world, hosting shapers in our &ldquo;house&rdquo;, and sharing knowledge so that the final product continues to be one of excitement and amazement when we deliver every single craft that we build.</p>\n<p>For more, check out&nbsp;<a title="Wavegliders" href="http://www.wavegliders.net/#/boards" target="_blank">http://www.wavegliders.net/</a></p>","wavegliders","wavegliders-slider.jpg",0

29,"SMILE - "Perfect Holiday"","<p>Karim Rejeb first blew us away with his short film "Lino" a few years back, now he's at it again with "Perfect Holiday." A 2.5 minute delight of new angles for a classic adventure. The worlds of stoke Karim creates with old plastic toys in empty dunes are stunning examples of how the simple act of opening our minds can provide all the stoke we need. The joys of life can found in the least likely of circumstances if we just believe. Thanks for sharing Karim!</p>\n<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/43107036" frameborder="0" width="720" height="405"></iframe></p>","smile-perfect-holiday","karim.jpg",0
